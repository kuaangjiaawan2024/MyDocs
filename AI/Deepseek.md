### Introduce
The purpose of writing this article is to run a large model on a laptop computer, similar to the effect of achieving online AI, such as Doubao, Baidu Wenxin Word and other     AI tools

The installation part of this article is only suitable for beginners with less foundation, and the master can ignore this link.

For reasons you all know, many of the actions in this article require a ladder to navigate.
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### Required software

Below is a list of the required sofware
- python
  - pip
- ollama
- open-webui



##### Python

The python environment is used to run the open-webui of the client, which can be used instead of the ollama terminal
pip is the package manager needed to install python




<br>
<br>
<br>
##### Ollama

Ollama is a large model management platform that provides everything you need to download and run large models.
  
It only takes very simple steps to run large models on the computer



##### Open-webui

 Usually, after you install ollama, you run the model and can only type text in the terminal, which is not too convenient to use, so you need an interface similar to other web version of AI tools, here it is recommended to use the open-webui program written in python
    



#### Destination

The goal of this article is to run deepseek's r1 1.5b model on a laptop, but it also applies to other models included on the ollama platform
